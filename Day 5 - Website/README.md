## _General info_

BestShop is my first, static website that uses only HTML and CSS. It contains anchors in navigation leading to individual sections like about us - so statistics, benefits, prices and contact - form. Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes were used for styling. I am rather not interested in developing this project and making it functional.
